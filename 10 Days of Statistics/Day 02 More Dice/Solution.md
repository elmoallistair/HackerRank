## Day 2: More Dice
### Task 
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6. 
** 1 / 9
** 1 / 6
** 2 / 3
** 5 / 6

### Answer
There are 4 from 36 posibilities of 2 dice with sum = 6 and each dice has different value.
|       | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **1** | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     |
| **2** | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     |
| **3** | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     |
| **4** | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    |
| **5** | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    | 11    |
| **6** | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    | 11    | 12    |
